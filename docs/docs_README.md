# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This directory contains all the living documents that define how OctoAcme teams run projects from idea to delivery.

## Summary of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme’s project delivery approach emphasizes:

- **Customer-first outcomes & clear goals**: All work ties directly to measurable customer and business value.
- **Iterative, measurable steps for planning and execution**: Projects are broken into deliverable increments with clear milestones and acceptance criteria.
- **Strong ownership roles** (PM, PdM, Developers, QA): Each team member has well-defined responsibilities, ensuring projects are managed efficiently with minimal ambiguity.
- **Consistent templates** for initiation, planning, risk, and retrospection: Teams rely on tried-and-true checklists and document formats for every project stage.
- **Transparent communication and metrics**: Regular team syncs, dashboards, and status reports keep all stakeholders informed and aligned.
- **Continuous improvement after each milestone or incident**: Retrospectives feed learnings and improvements into future projects, ensuring teams get better with every cycle.
